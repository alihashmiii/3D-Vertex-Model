# 3DVertexModel

`@Author: Ali Hashmi`

`Mathematica Version: 12.1`

`Dependency: IGraphM for the SubIsomorphicQ function` (https://github.com/szhorvat/IGraphM)


The project contains an implementation of a vertex model to simulate biological tissues in 3D. Currently, the repository houses the Mathematica notebook `vertex model 3D.nb` for simulating an infinite sheet of cells in a monolayer. However, this code can be easily modified to simulate cells in 3D agglomerates/aggregates - which are essentially easier to simulate than an infinite sheet.


### To-Do List:
- cell division event to create a new polyhedron
- cell death to remove a polyhedron from the mesh


## Notes

- If you use or modify the code to disseminate the results in a publication/presentation, you would need to cite the author's repository and ask for permission. 

- The code is based on and is a modification of *Okuda et al 2012, "Reversible network reconnection model for simulating large deformation in dynamic tissue morphogenesis"*
