# 3DVertexModel

`@Author: Ali Hashmi`

`Mathematica Version: 12.1`

The project contains an implementation of a vertex model to simulate biological tissues in 3D. Currently, the repository houses the Mathematica notebooks for simulating an infinite sheet of cells in monolayer. However, this code can be easily modified to simulate cells in 3D agglomerates/aggregates.


### To-Do List:
- cell division event to create a new polyhedron
- cell death to remove a polyhedron from the mesh


## Notes

The code in the repository is to be used with the author's permission. The code is based on and a modification of Okuda et al 2012, "Reversible network reconnection model for simulating large deformation in dynamic tissue morphogenesis"
