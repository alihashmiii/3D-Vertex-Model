# 3DVertexModel

@Author: Ali Hashmi

vertex model implementation to simulate biological tissue in 3D

To add:
- cell division event to create a new polyhedron
- cell death to remove a polyhedron from the mesh



## Recent Changes

- In the collision detection module, `Polygon` was swapped with `Polyhedron` and `DiscretizeGraphics` with `BoundaryMeshRegion`.
