# 3DVertexModel

`@Author: Ali Hashmi`

`Mathematica Version: 12.1`

`Dependency: IGraphM` (https://github.com/szhorvat/IGraphM)


The project contains an implementation of a vertex model to simulate biological tissues in 3D. Currently, the repository houses the Mathematica notebooks for simulating an infinite sheet of cells in a monolayer. However, this code can be easily modified to simulate cells in 3D agglomerates/aggregates - which are essentially easier to simulate than an infinite sheet.


### To-Do List:
- cell division event to create a new polyhedron
- cell death to remove a polyhedron from the mesh


## Notes

- The code in the repository is to be used with the author's permission. 
- The code is based on and is a modification of *Okuda et al 2012, "Reversible network reconnection model for simulating large deformation in dynamic tissue morphogenesis"*
