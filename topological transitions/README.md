This is a testing module to check if the edge to triangle operation
and the reverse operation are working as expected.

Please note that in the testing module instead of transforming a triangle face
to an edge I am merely transforming a 4-sided face to an edge for convenience.
However, in the actual simulation module only the triangle faces undergo transformation.
